# MockSSL: This tool creates a local self-signed certificate (SubjAltName not available)
# for Developing webapps locally.

# HEADS UP!
# SANs have never been required but now that Chrome 58 has been released, several of our internal
# SHA2 sites are coming up as insecure because they do not use SANs.
#
# Subject Alternative Names have always been optional and only to be used when your site requires
# more that just one name to be associated with your certificate.
